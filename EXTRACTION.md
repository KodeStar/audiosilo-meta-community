# Extracting characters and recaps from a book you own

This guide is the sibling of [AUTHORING.md](AUTHORING.md). AUTHORING.md defines
WHAT a good characters/recaps sidecar is (the spoiler model, the copyright
rules, the caps); this guide is a repeatable process for PRODUCING one from the
text of a book you own, using a chain of model passes plus the `metaextract`
tool. Read AUTHORING.md first - everything there applies to the output of this
process.

If the only source you have is an audiobook, use the local-ASR process in
[EXTRACTION-AUDIO.md](EXTRACTION-AUDIO.md) instead. It preserves the same
rolling fact pass, notes-only synthesis boundary, and independent audits.

**Where the commands run.** The `metaextract`, `metafmt` and `metacheck`
commands below live in the core repository, `KodeStar/audiosilo-meta`; this
repository holds the data. Run them from a core checkout with this repository's
`data/` named explicitly - see AUTHORING.md's "Where the commands run" and this
repository's README.md.

Use this process when authoring from model memory is too weak: long serials,
less-famous titles, or any book where chapter-accurate positions matter and
recall cannot be trusted. Working from the text solves both problems at once:
positions come from the book's own chapter list, and every fact in the output
can be traced to the chapter it appears in.

## Ground rules

- **The book text never enters the repository.** Not the epub, not extracted
  chapter text, not fact notes derived from it. Work in a temporary directory;
  only the two derived CC BY-SA sidecar files are ever committed. (This is the
  same rule as personal library exports: the repo holds derived metadata,
  never source material.)
- The input is **an epub you have**. How you came to have it is out of scope
  for this guide; converting or acquiring books is not covered here.
- The CC0 core must exist first: the work, at least one recording, the people,
  and the series entry (see
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/KodeStar/audiosilo-meta/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  in the core repository). Sidecars attach to a work.
- Everything in AUTHORING.md's Copyright section applies to the final output,
  and step 4 checks it mechanically.

## The pipeline at a glance

```
epub
 └─ 1. split      metaextract split (mechanical: chapter text + manifest)
 └─ 2. fact pass  rolling per-chapter notes, in order (cheap model)
 └─ 3. synthesis  the characters + recaps members from the NOTES ONLY (strong model)
 └─ 4. verify     metafmt + metacheck + metaextract ngram + a spoiler audit
```

The load-bearing design decision is between steps 2 and 3: the synthesis stage
never sees the book text, only the chapter-attributed fact notes. That makes
spoiler bounds auditable (every fact in a card or recap traces to a noted
chapter) and makes verbatim overlap with the text structurally impossible -
the mechanical check in step 4 then proves it.

## Step 1: split the epub

```sh
go run ./cmd/metaextract split --epub book.epub -o /tmp/book-split
```

This writes one plain-text file per emitted section (`001.txt`, ...) plus
`manifest.json`. Usually a section is a whole spine document; when the toc
points several entries at fragments INSIDE one document
(`ch07.xhtml#c8`), that document is split at those anchors and each chapter
gets its own file. Every entry records `index` (the emitted file), `spine`
(the spine document the text came from), the `anchor` it was cut at, the toc
`label`, a `chapter` number when the label states one outright, and word
counts. The manifest also carries a `metadata` block read from the OPF -
title/subtitle, authors, language, publisher, a check-digit-validated ISBN,
and the series - which is what identifies the book to the catalogue.

`chapter` is only ever filled from a label that STATES a number ("Chapter 12",
"12", "12. The Reckoning", "Chapter Twelve", "CHAPTER XII. The Reckoning").
Labels that merely look numeric ("XII An Irate Neighbor", where "I" is also an
English word) are left unnumbered here on purpose; a consumer that wants them
parses `label` itself and confirms the reading against the whole book.

Review the manifest before going further - it IS the position model:

- The chaptered docs should match the book's real chapter count. If the toc
  has no usable labels (or one file holds many chapters whose anchors are
  missing from the markup), the manifest carries warnings; you will need to
  split or map chapters by hand before step 2. Split never invents a cut
  point - an anchor it cannot find is reported, not guessed at.
- Unlabeled docs at the edges are front matter and back matter. Check the back
  matter: epubs often carry a teaser excerpt of ANOTHER book (the Killing
  Floor epub ends with the opening chapter of Die Trying). Excerpts must not
  reach the fact pass.
- Position rule reminder from AUTHORING.md: positions are the book's own
  logical chapter numbers, edition-independent. If the book has Parts or
  unnumbered chapters, decide the mapping now and keep it fixed for the whole
  run.

## Step 2: the rolling fact pass

A cheap, fast model reads the chapters IN ORDER and writes per-chapter notes
plus a cumulative "what the reader knows" sheet. Chunk the book (8-9 chapters
per chunk works well; one chunk per model session/agent) and run the chunks
SEQUENTIALLY - each chunk starts from the previous chunk's cumulative sheet,
never from the raw earlier chapters.

Per chapter, the notes record:

- EVENTS: 6-15 chronological bullets; outcomes stated plainly.
- INTRODUCED: characters first meaningfully appearing in this chapter, as the
  reader knows them AT THAT POINT (no later knowledge).
- DEVELOPMENTS: new facts about already-known characters.
- STATE: the protagonist's situation, reader beliefs, open questions.
- ACT BREAK CANDIDATE where the chapter ends on a natural catch-up point
  (these become recap through-points in step 3).

The cumulative sheet carries ROSTER (name, first-appearance chapter, status,
chapter of death where relevant), REVEALS (chapter -> reveal timeline), and
THREADS. The final chunk also writes the whole-book sheet with a plain ENDING
statement (it feeds `in_short`/`ending`).

Prompt template: see "The prompt set" below.

Rules that make step 3 safe:

- Own words only, no quotes from the book at all - the notes feed published
  text downstream.
- Exact chapter attribution; an event belongs to the chapter where it is
  confirmed on the page.
- Never read ahead of the chunk; never re-read earlier chapters (trust the
  sheet - that is what keeps attribution honest).

## Step 3: synthesis

A strong model turns the notes - and ONLY the notes, never the book text -
into the work's `characters` and `recaps` members per AUTHORING.md. Points that need
deciding per book:

- **Cast size**: 12-18 cards suits a typical novel; cover the cast a listener
  would look up, skip one-scene walk-ons.
- **Twist characters**: a `role` of `antagonist` on a character whose betrayal
  is a late reveal leaks the twist at their (early) reveal chapter. Use the
  role they APPEAR to have at reveal, or omit `role`.
- **Through-points**: scale the count with the book's length and density per
  AUTHORING.md, normally every 5-10 chapters or 2-4 listening hours at natural
  act breaks; the final entry is through the last chapter and states the actual
  ending plainly.
- **Book 1 vs book N**: only book 2+ gets the `chapter: 0` + `scope: "series"`
  "previously" recap. A series opener has none.
- Both files: `license` `"CC-BY-SA-4.0"`, `sources` `[{"type": "community"}]`.

Prompt template: see "The prompt set" below.

## Step 4: verify (never skip this)

Mechanical, from the repo root:

```sh
go run ./cmd/metafmt --write
go run ./cmd/metacheck
go run ./cmd/metaextract ngram --source /tmp/book-split \
  data/works-community/<dir>/<bound>.json
```

`ngram` fails (exit 1) on any 8-word near-verbatim overlap between an authored
description/recap and the book text, after case/punctuation normalization.
A hit means a sentence needs rewriting in genuinely fresh words.

Then the spoiler audit: a SEPARATE model session (not the one that wrote the
sidecars) checks every card and recap against the fact notes:

- No fact in a description is attributed to a chapter later than the card's
  `reveal`.
- No fact in a recap is attributed to a chapter later than its `through`.
- Statuses, deaths, and the ending are accurate to the notes.
- Caps, voice, and the AUTHORING.md checklist hold.

Every extraction and authoring wave so far has had real defects caught in this
pass (leaked late-book facts, misattributed deaths, timelines running early).
Treat a clean audit as the exit criterion, not a formality.

## The prompt set

The templates below are the ones the exemplar run used, generalized. `<...>`
marks placeholders. They are model-agnostic; run each as a fresh session (or
agent) with file access to the working directory.

The templates deliberately restate the length caps and core rules so each
prompt is a self-contained copy-paste artifact - but AUTHORING.md and the
schemas own those numbers. If a cap or rule changes there, update these
templates in the same change.

### Step 2: fact pass (one prompt per chunk, run sequentially)

```
You are stage <K> of a rolling fact-extraction pass over the novel "<TITLE>"
by <AUTHOR> (<CHAPTER-COUNT> chapters<, first-person narration by X if so>).
Your notes are the ground truth for later spoiler-safe character cards and
recaps - exact chapter attribution is the whole point.

[Stages after the first:]
FIRST read the cumulative reader-knowledge sheet from the previous stage:
<dir>/facts/knowledge-through-ch<M>.md

THEN read, in order, chapters <M+1> through <N>:
<dir>/chapters/ch<M+1>.txt ... ch<N>.txt

Write TWO files:

1. <dir>/facts/facts-ch<M+1>-<N>.md - a section per chapter (## Chapter N),
   each with:
   - EVENTS: 6-15 chronological bullets of what happens. State outcomes
     plainly (deaths, identifications, reveals). Facts only.
   - INTRODUCED: characters first meaningfully appearing in this chapter -
     the name the reader knows them by AT THIS POINT, who they appear to be
     at introduction only (no later knowledge), aliases/titles used.
   - DEVELOPMENTS: new facts about already-introduced characters (cross-check
     the roster - do not re-introduce someone already known).
   - STATE: 2-4 bullets - protagonist situation, current reader beliefs,
     open questions.
   - If the chapter ends on a major turning point / natural act break:
     ACT BREAK CANDIDATE: <why>.

2. <dir>/facts/knowledge-through-ch<N>.md - the FULL updated cumulative sheet
   as of the END of chapter <N> (carry forward everything still true, update
   statuses, add new characters/reveals/threads):
   - ROSTER: every named character - name, aliases, first-appearance chapter,
     apparent role, current status (alive/dead with chapter of death), what
     the reader knows about them.
   - REVEALS: timeline of major reveals (chapter -> what was revealed).
   - THREADS: open questions/mysteries.

HARD RULES:
- OWN WORDS ONLY. Never copy or lightly reword sentences from the text - no
  quotes from the book at all. Short factual reference-guide phrasing.
- Neutral voice, no opinions about the book.
- Exact chapter attribution; an event is attributed to the chapter where it
  is confirmed on the page.
- Hyphens only, never em dashes.
- Do not read beyond ch<N>.txt, and do not re-read earlier chapters - trust
  the sheet.
```

For the final chunk, additionally have it write `knowledge-final.md`: the
whole-book ROSTER and REVEALS plus an ENDING section - a plain, factual
statement of how the book ends, where every surviving major player stands,
and which threads stay open into the next book.

### Step 3: synthesis (one prompt)

```
You are the synthesis stage of the extraction pipeline. Author the CC BY-SA
sidecars for "<TITLE>" (<series position; chapter count; narration>) in the
audiosilo-meta repo.

THE CONTRACT: read AUTHORING.md first and follow it exactly (positions and
spoiler model, copyright caps, voice). Skim one existing exemplar pair of
characters + recaps entry for shape.

YOUR ONLY SOURCE MATERIAL is the fact notes (you do NOT have the book text -
deliberate: it makes spoiler bounds auditable and verbatim overlap impossible
by construction). Read all of <dir>/facts/*.md.

Write the work's characters and recaps into its works-community entry -
data/works-community/<dir>/<bound>.json, one entry keyed by the work slug with
a "characters" and a "recaps" member (the parent work must already exist; add
the entry to the pack whose range covers the slug and let `metafmt --write`
place it):

the characters member
- 12-18 cards covering the meaningful cast; skip one-scene walk-ons.
- reveal.chapter: first meaningful introduction per the facts (exact).
- role ONLY where it does not spoil: a late-revealed traitor gets the role
  they APPEAR to have at reveal, or no role at all.
- description: for a reader who has JUST reached the reveal chapter - no
  knowledge from any later chapter. Target 200-500 chars (cap 1500).
- No xref unless verified.

the recaps member
- Book 2+ gets a chapter-0 scope-series "previously" recap; a series opener
  gets none.
- Scale through-points with length and density per AUTHORING.md, normally every
  5-10 chapters or 2-4 listening hours at natural ACT BREAK candidates; each
  entry is a cumulative catch-up revealing ONLY facts attributed to chapters
  <= its through chapter. Target ~150-300 words each (cap 3000 chars).
- The FINAL entry is through the last chapter and states the actual ending
  plainly - outcomes, deaths, where the protagonist goes. Never a tease.
- in_short (<= 1500 chars): the whole arc in one paragraph, ending included.
- ending (<= 2000 chars): the sequel-handoff state - where every surviving
  major player stands, which threads stay open.

HARD RULES: license CC-BY-SA-4.0, sources [{"type": "community"}]; fresh
prose in your own words (an 8-word-shingle check against the full text will
be run on the output); neutral reference-guide voice; hyphens never em
dashes; when a fact's chapter attribution is uncertain, leave the fact out.

Then run: go run ./cmd/metafmt --write && go run ./cmd/metacheck - both must
pass.
```

### Step 4: the spoiler audit (one prompt, a fresh session - never the author)

```
You are an independent ADVERSARIAL auditor. Another agent authored the
spoiler-tagged sidecars for "<TITLE>"; find defects, do not approve. Assume
defects exist until proven otherwise.

Read AUTHORING.md, then audit the work's characters and recaps members in
data/works-community/<dir>/<bound>.json against the ground truth in
<dir>/facts/*.md.

Checks, in priority order:
1. SPOILER LEAKS: every claim in every description traces to a chapter <=
   the card's reveal; every claim in every recap to a chapter <= its through.
   Roles/aliases must not leak later twists. "Implies" counts as a leak.
2. REVEAL/THROUGH CORRECTNESS: reveal = first meaningful introduction (too
   late is also a defect); through-points at sensible act breaks.
3. ACCURACY: names, statuses, chapter-of-death, the ending - consistent with
   the facts; flag any claim not present in the facts at all.
4. COVERAGE: look-up-worthy characters with no card; spans with no recap.
5. CONTRACT: voice, caps, plain-stated ending, no em dashes, series-opener
   rule, license/sources fields.

Do NOT rewrite the files. Report numbered findings, each with severity
(BLOCKER / FIX / NIT), locus, offending text, fact-file evidence (which
chapter the fact belongs to), and the suggested correction. Say explicitly
when a category is clean.
```

Feed the findings back to the synthesis session (or a fresh one) to apply,
then re-run the step 4 mechanical checks. Iterate until the audit is clean of
BLOCKER/FIX findings.

## Worked example: Killing Floor

The pipeline was validated end-to-end on Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1,
34 chapters, ~142k words of chapter text):

- split: 43 spine docs -> 34 toc-labeled chapters inferred exactly; front
  matter and a bonus excerpt of the NEXT book correctly left unlabeled (and
  excluded from the fact pass).
- fact pass: 4 sequential chunks (ch 1-9, 10-18, 19-26, 27-34), each ~30-40k
  words of reading, handing forward a cumulative knowledge sheet.
- synthesis: 16 character cards + 8 recap through-points (6, 9, 13, 18, 23,
  26, 30, 34) + in_short + ending, from the notes alone.
- audit: found 1 genuine cross-chapter leak (a ch13 fact in a ch9 card), a
  coverage gap, and 3 pre-reveal characterization nits - all fixed and
  re-verified (final set: 20 cards). The mechanical ngram check found 0
  overlaps.

The full prompts above are the ones this run used.
