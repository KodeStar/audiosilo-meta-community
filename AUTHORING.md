# Authoring characters and recaps (the CC BY-SA layer)

This guide covers the **expressive layer** of the database: community-authored
**character** entries and **recaps** ("story so far" summaries). It is separate
from
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/KodeStar/audiosilo-meta/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
which covers the factual CC0 core (works, recordings, people, series) in the
core repository. Read
[LICENSING.md](https://github.com/KodeStar/audiosilo-meta/blob/main/LICENSING.md)
first - this layer is **CC BY-SA 4.0**, not CC0, and it carries real copyright
obligations the core does not.

**Where the commands run.** This repository holds the community data; the
tooling lives in the core repository, `KodeStar/audiosilo-meta`. Every
`go run ./cmd/...` line below is run from a checkout of THAT repository, with
this repository's `data/` named explicitly and the community profile selected:

```sh
cd ../audiosilo-meta      # the core checkout, beside this one
go run ./cmd/metafmt  --write -data ../audiosilo-meta-community/data --profile community
go run ./cmd/metacheck       -data ../audiosilo-meta-community/data --profile community
```

See this repository's README.md for the full local-validation flow.

If you are filling out a whole series, do the CC0 core first (the works,
recordings, people, and series must already exist and validate) and add these
sidecars on top.

To PRODUCE these sidecars from a book you own (rather than from memory), follow
the text pipeline in [EXTRACTION.md](EXTRACTION.md) or the audio-only pipeline
in [EXTRACTION-AUDIO.md](EXTRACTION-AUDIO.md). They establish chapter-accurate
positions and add a mechanical no-verbatim check. Everything in this guide
still applies to their output.

## The two sidecars

Both are **per-work sidecars**, and both live in the same place: one entry in the
`works-community` family, keyed by the work slug, holding up to two members.

```
data/works-community/<dir>/<bound>.json

{
  "entries": {
    "a-deadly-education": {
      "characters": { ... },   # the cast, spoiler-tagged
      "recaps":     { ... }    # position-keyed "story so far"
    }
  }
}
```

The family is separate from `data/works/` so the licence boundary is structural:
everything in `works-community` is **CC BY-SA 4.0**, everything in the core
families is CC0. Each member carries `work` (the parent work slug, which must
equal the entry key), `license` (**must** be `"CC-BY-SA-4.0"`), and `sources`.

Add your entry to the community pack whose range covers the work slug - or the
nearest one - and run `go run ./cmd/metafmt --write`: it places the entry
correctly and re-renders the file. The two sections below describe each member's
own shape; where they say "the file", read "the member".

### characters

```json
{
  "work": "a-deadly-education",
  "license": "CC-BY-SA-4.0",
  "sources": [{ "type": "community" }],
  "characters": [
    {
      "id": "el",
      "name": "El",
      "aliases": ["Galadriel Higgins"],
      "role": "protagonist",
      "reveal": { "chapter": 1 },
      "description": "A senior at the Scholomance with an affinity for mass destruction she refuses to use, scraping through on spite and hard-won craft.",
      "xref": { "wikidata": "Q..." }
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`id`** - a slug, unique **within this file** (not globally: two different
  works may each have a `narrator` or a `the-king`). Derive it from the name.
- **`name`** - the character's primary name as a reader of *this* book would know
  it.
- **`aliases`** (optional) - other names/titles. Omit the key if there are none.
- **`role`** (optional) - one of `protagonist`, `antagonist`, `supporting`,
  `minor`. The value must be safe at the reveal position: do not label an
  apparent ally as an antagonist when that is learned later. Use the apparent
  role at reveal or omit it if genuinely unclear.
- **`reveal`** (required) - the position where the character is first
  meaningfully introduced **in this book** (see Positions below).
- **`description`** (optional but expected) - your own words, **≤ 1500
  characters** (see Copyright).
- **`xref`** (optional) - `wikidata` (a `Q...` id) and/or `goodreads`. A shared
  `wikidata` QID is how the **same character across a series** is linked: each
  book gets its own card, and the QID ties them together. Only include a QID you
  have actually verified points at this character.

### recaps

```json
{
  "work": "the-last-graduate",
  "license": "CC-BY-SA-4.0",
  "sources": [{ "type": "community" }],
  "in_short": "The whole book in one paragraph, ending included, for someone about to start the next one.",
  "ending": "How the book closes: where every major player stands, and which threads stay open.",
  "recaps": [
    {
      "through": { "chapter": 0 },
      "scope": "series",
      "text": "Previously: El survived her senior year's first term at the Scholomance and reluctantly let Orion Lake befriend her..."
    },
    {
      "through": { "chapter": 6 },
      "scope": "book",
      "text": "So far this book: ..."
    }
  ]
}
```

A recaps file has two layers: **chaptered `recaps`** (spoiler-gated "story so
far" entries, the differentiator) and two optional **whole-book summaries**
(`in_short` and `ending`) for a reader who has already finished the book and
wants a fast refresher before the sequel. Structure your entries like a
dedicated recap site, but keep the neutral reference-guide **voice** (see
Copyright) - never their jokey, editorializing tone.

- **`recaps[].through`** (required) - the recap is safe to show to a listener who
  has **finished this chapter** (see Positions).
- **`recaps[].scope`** (optional) - `book` (recaps only this book) or `series`
  (also covers earlier books). A `chapter: 0` + `scope: "series"` entry is the
  "previously, in earlier books" recap - the single most useful recap in a
  series, shown when someone starts the next book.
- **`recaps[].text`** (required) - your own words, **≤ 3000 characters**, target
  **~150-300 words** per entry. The cap is **per entry** and the entry count is
  unbounded: recap capacity scales with the book by **adding through-points**,
  never by cramming more into one entry. Scale the count with the book's length
  and density - a short middle-grade book might carry 3-4 points; a 30-60+ hour
  epic or serial volume 12-20 or more. Rule of thumb: one through-point every
  ~5-10 chapters or ~2-4 listening hours, at natural act/arc breaks. An entry
  bumping the cap is the signal to **split** its span into two through-points,
  not to compress harder. The **final** chaptered entry must carry through the
  **actual ending** - state outcomes plainly; "reveals just enough to..."
  teasing is a defect, not a style.
- No two recaps in one file may share a `through` chapter.
- **`in_short`** (optional) - the **whole arc in one paragraph, ending
  included**: the fastest possible refresher for someone about to start the next
  book. Own words, **≤ 1500 characters**, target **~120-200 words** (one
  paragraph).
- **`ending`** (optional) - **how the book ends**, the sequel-handoff state:
  where every major player stands at the close and which threads stay open.
  State it plainly - never a tease. Own words, **≤ 2000 characters**, target
  **~150-300 words**. It is deliberately capped tighter than a chaptered `text`
  entry: a crisp handoff into the next book, **not** another full recap.
- `in_short` and `ending` describe the finished book, so they are inherently
  full-spoiler; a consumer only shows them to a reader who has completed the
  book (or who opts in).

## Positions (the spoiler model)

Every character and recap is tagged with a **position**: `{ "chapter": N }`.

- `chapter` is the **logical chapter of the work** - the book's own chapter
  numbering, 1-based. It is **edition-independent**: it is NOT the recording's
  track/marker number (recordings vary - some mark Parts or Books, some number
  chapters, some are abridged). Use the chapter as printed in the book.
- `chapter: 0` means front matter or knowledge carried from **earlier books** in
  the series (a character the reader already knows; a "story so far" recap).
- A consumer (the site, the player) compares the listener's current position
  against these numbers and only reveals what is already safe. That is the whole
  point: **get the position right and the spoiler protection is automatic.**

Guidance:

- For a **character**, `reveal.chapter` is where they are first named/introduced
  in *this* book. A returning series character introduced on page one is
  `chapter: 1` (or `0` if they are purely prior-book knowledge at the start).
- Write the **description for a reader who has just reached `reveal.chapter`** -
  do not fold in a late-book twist about that character. If a character's role
  changes dramatically later, that is a *different, later* recap's job, or a
  second character card in a later book.
- For **recaps**, place a `through` at natural catch-up points (see the
  recaps section for how many and how often, and always include a
  `chapter: 0` series recap for book 2+). Each recap may freely reveal
  everything **up to and including** its `through` chapter, and nothing after.

## Copyright (this is the load-bearing part)

Publication is the risk surface, so these rules are hard requirements, not
style:

1. **Own words only. No verbatim or near-verbatim text** from the book, its
   jacket copy, or any wiki. Paraphrase from memory of the facts; do not
   reword sentences from a source. Short, factual, reference-guide phrasing.
2. **Length caps are enforced by the schema** (character description ≤ 1500,
   recap `text` ≤ 3000, `in_short` ≤ 1500, `ending` ≤ 2000 characters) and exist
   for a legal reason - a dense, blow-by-blow plot reconstruction is the danger
   zone. The raised recap cap buys **depth per entry**, not a licence to retell
   the book scene by scene. Summarize, do not retell.
3. **Neutral reference-guide voice.** Recap blogs are chatty and opinionated
   ("X is an arse"); we are not. No jokes, no editorializing, no profanity, no
   value judgements about the book or its characters - just what happens, stated
   plainly. Take the *structure* from those sites, never the tone.
4. **Facts, not invention.** Describe only what actually happens in the book. If
   you are unsure of a detail, **omit it** - an omitted field is always better
   than a fabricated one. (This is the same rule as the CC0 core.)
5. **Reference-guide framing**, non-commercial. This is an index to help a
   listener, not a substitute for the book.
6. Rightsholders can request removal per book; keep `sources` accurate so any
   contribution can be audited or retracted.

## Format and validation

- `license` is `"CC-BY-SA-4.0"`. A manual contribution from the author's own
  knowledge may use `sources: [{ "type": "community" }]`. An automated
  audiobook/ebook extraction **must** use one community source whose `ref`
  identifies the edition actually processed, for example
  `audible:us:B012345678`, `isbn:9780123456789`, or
  `audiosilo-meta:recording:<work>/<recording>`. The authoring tool or pipeline
  name alone is not provenance. Add `imported_at` when the extraction date is
  known.
- Run the gate before submitting:
  ```sh
  go run ./cmd/metafmt --write     # canonical formatting (sorted keys, 2-space)
  go run ./cmd/metacheck           # schema + integrity + uniqueness
  ```
  metacheck enforces: valid JSON Schema, `work` matches the directory, the
  parent work exists, character ids are unique within the file, and recap
  positions are unique within the file.

## Checklist

- [ ] The work, its recording(s), author, and narrator already exist and validate.
- [ ] `work` equals the entry key both members sit under.
- [ ] `license` is `"CC-BY-SA-4.0"`; `sources` present.
- [ ] Every character has an `id` (unique within this work's characters member), `name`, and `reveal`.
- [ ] Descriptions/texts are your own words, within the caps, and accurate
      (character ≤ 1500, recap `text` ≤ 3000, `in_short` ≤ 1500, `ending` ≤ 2000).
- [ ] The final chaptered recap states the **actual ending**, not a tease; `ending`
      and `in_short` (if present) carry the real outcome plainly.
- [ ] Voice is neutral reference-guide - no jokes, editorializing, or profanity.
- [ ] Positions use the book's own (logical) chapter numbers; `0` = prior-book.
- [ ] Book 2+ has a `chapter: 0` series recap; a series opener does not.
- [ ] `metafmt --write` and `metacheck` both pass.
