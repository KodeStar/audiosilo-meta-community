# Resolve ONE conflicted pack file by merging the two sides' entries.
#
# COPY. The source of truth for this script is scripts/pack-union-merge.sh in
# KodeStar/audiosilo-meta, where it is driven through real rebases by
# scripts/packmerge_test.go. This is a verbatim copy with this header added: the
# community tree is pack storage under the same PACK-SPEC.md rules, so it needs
# the same driver, and the rule this repository exercises is the works-community
# one below (disjoint members merge, a member both sides wrote is a refusal).
# Fix a bug in core first, then copy the file across; do not fork it.
#
# Two pull requests that add records in the same slug range edit the same pack
# file, and git sees overlapping hunks. Usually nothing is in dispute: each side
# added its own entries to a sorted map. This merges the entry maps and leaves
# the result for `metafmt --write` to re-render canonically and re-place (an
# entry that lands in the wrong pack is relocated by the same pass).
#
# It is a THREE-WAY merge, not a union of the two sides. A union cannot express a
# deletion: the side that removed an entry would have it handed back by the side
# that still has it - silently, with a green gate. So the merge BASE decides what
# each difference means:
#
#   present on both sides, identical      keep it
#   present on one side, absent from base that side added it: keep it
#   present on one side, in base unchanged the other side DELETED it: delete it
#   present on one side, in base changed   delete versus modify: refuse
#   absent from both sides                 both deleted it: it stays deleted
#   present on both sides, different       see below
#
# An entry both sides changed is a real conflict with TWO exceptions, each
# applied one level deeper and each to one family, because what sits one level
# down differs per family:
#
#   works            an entry whose own fields are identical and whose
#                    "recordings" maps differ is merged by the same rules over
#                    those maps. Two pull requests adding different narrations of
#                    one book collide on exactly that and nothing else.
#   works-community  the entry IS a map of independent members ("characters",
#                    "recaps"), each its own licensed document, so the base rules
#                    apply to that map directly. A characters pull request and a
#                    recaps pull request for the same book each create or edit
#                    ONE member of the same entry, which is the same collision
#                    one family over.
#
# Both are the most common intake collisions there are. Everything else - a
# member or a recording both sides wrote, a work's own fields differing, a person
# or a series entry both sides changed - stays a refusal.
#
# WHICH exception applies is decided by the FAMILY the pack file belongs to (its
# path), not by sniffing the entry: the family is what fixes the shape of an
# entry, and a rule that guessed from the keys present would quietly start
# merging a family it was never reasoned about.
#
# Usage, from inside a rebase or merge that stopped on a conflict:
#
#   scripts/pack-union-merge.sh data/works/0/0.json
#   go run ./cmd/metafmt --write && go run ./cmd/metacheck
#   git add data && git rebase --continue
#
# It also runs as a git MERGE DRIVER, which is how the intake sweep uses it:
#
#   git config merge.packjson.name "three-way merge of pack-file entries"
#   git config merge.packjson.driver "scripts/pack-union-merge.sh %O %A %B %P"
#
# .gitattributes already maps data/**/*.json to that driver, so configuring it is
# all it takes (git falls back to its own line merge where it is not configured,
# which is what every other checkout keeps doing). The driver is not an
# optimization: git's LINE merge is unsound for a pack file. Two branches that
# add the SAME entry key in one pack usually collide and stop, but when one side
# also changed the entry NEXT to it the two insertions can be anchored at
# different lines, and git then applies both - one file with the key in it TWICE
# (a works-community entry once with its characters member and once with its
# recaps member, exactly what should have merged). Nothing downstream can repair
# that: a duplicate key is not valid pack storage, so pkg/pack refuses the file
# and metafmt cannot re-render it. As a driver this script sees the same three
# versions BEFORE any line merge happens and merges the entry maps instead, so
# the shape cannot arise; when it refuses, git records the conflict as usual.
#
# It merges PACK files and nothing else: a version that is not a pack (no
# top-level "entries" object) is refused rather than treated as an empty one, so
# the tree's one non-pack file - data/redirects.json, the slug tombstone table -
# cannot be emptied by a merge that reports success. .gitattributes keeps that file
# away from the driver as well; this is the backstop for a stale checkout or a hand
# invocation.
#
# Exit codes: 0 merged, 1 the file cannot be merged this way, 2 usage,
# 5 a real conflict that needs a person (as a merge driver, any non-zero exit
# tells git the file is conflicted). Requires jq.
